<h1>The Social Computer project</h1>
<p>The Social Computer is a prototype of a computing machine that is fully driven by human activity and input. The engine reacts upon bursts of activity on the social Web and autonomously engages with human users to stimulate their contributions to crowdsourcing microtasks. Currently the system can interact with users on Twitter and facebook as well as via a Chrome extension.</p>
<h2>How to interact with the Social Computer?</h2>
<p>The Social Computer supports a set of fundamental instructions. By responding with these instructions and your additional input to messages the Social Computer sends out via Twitter or facebook the users shape the algorithms the Social Computer runs.</p>
