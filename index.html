<h1>The Social Computer project</h1>
<p>The Social Computer is a prototype of a computing machine that is fully driven by human activity and input. The engine reacts upon bursts of activity on the social Web and autonomously engages with human users to stimulate their contributions to crowdsourcing microtasks. Currently the system can interact with users on Twitter and facebook as well as via a Chrome extension.</p>
